\section{Introduction}
Support Vector Machines lie in the set of maximum margin classifiers within the realm of expert system classifiers.  The algorithm attempts to define a hyper-plane decision boundary that separates two sets of labeled data sets with maximal distance from the closed points of those two sets. Through the use of a "kernel-trick", or kernel functions, the algorithm \documentclass[11pt]{beamer}
